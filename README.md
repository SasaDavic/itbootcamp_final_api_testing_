# API Testing Final Project

## 📋 About the Project
This project is a **Postman API testing collection** that tests a simple API with functionalities like user authentication, city management, and user profile handling.  
The tests cover **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for multiple endpoints.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used
- **Postman** (for API testing)
- **Postman Test Scripts** (JavaScript-based assertions)
- **Chai Assertion Library** (for advanced assertion handling inside Postman)
- **Swagger** (for understanding API endpoints and documentation)

## 🧪 Tested API Endpoints
- **Auth**: Login and register
- **City**: Create, read, update, and delete cities
- **Profile**: Manage user profiles
- **User**: User administration (Create/Update/Delete)
